GGH Applications 
==================

Because it uses a regular cell lattice and regular field lattices, GGH simulations are often faster than equivalent *Finite Element (FE)* simulations operating at the same spatial granularity and level of modeling detail, permitting simulation of tens to hundreds of thousands of cells on lattices of up to :math:`1024^3` pixels on a single processor. This speed, combined with the ability to add biological mechanisms via terms in the effective energy, permit GGH modeling of a wide variety of situations, including: tumor growth [5]-[9], gastrulation [10]-[12], skin pigmentation [13]-[16], neurospheres [17], angiogenesis [18]-[23], the immune system [24][25], yeast colony growth (26, 27), *myxobacteria* [28]-[31], stem-cell differentiation [32][33], Dictyostelium discoideum [34]-[37], simulated evolution [38]-[43], general developmental patterning [14][44], convergent extension [45][46], epidermal formation [47], hydra regeneration [48][49], plant growth, retinal patterning [50][51], wound healing [47][52][53], biofilms [54]-[57], and limb-bud development [58][59].
