What is CompuCell3D?
---------------------
CompuCell3D is an open-source simulation environment for multi-cell, single-cell-based modeling of tissues, organs and organisms. 

It uses `Cellular Potts Model`_ to model cell behavior. For technical details about modeling please refer  `Multi-Scale Modeling of Tissues Using CompuCell3D paper`_.

This project is funded by the NIH and EPA.

Goal of this manual
---------------------
The goal of this manual is to teach biomodelers how to effectively use multi-scale, multi-cell simulation environment CompuCell3D to build, test, run and post-process simulations of biological phenomena occurring at single cell, tissue or even up to single organism levels.
